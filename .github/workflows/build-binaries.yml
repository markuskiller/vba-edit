          ## Windows Binaries (Unsigned)
          
          ⚠️ **Note**: These binaries are currently unsigned. Windows SmartScreen may show warnings.
          
          ### Installation
          1. Download the appropriate `*-vba.exe` file
          2. When Windows shows a SmartScreen warning, click "More info" then "Run anyway"
          3. Place the executable in a directory on your PATH
          
          See [Windows Executable Guide](https://github.com/markuskiller/vba-edit/blob/main/docs/WINDOWS_EXECUTABLE_GUIDE.md) for detailed installation instructions.
