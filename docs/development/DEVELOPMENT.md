## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Windows (required for COM interface with MS Office)
- Git

### Initial Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd vba-editRD
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```shell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
# or
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
```

or in VS Code, 
- open command palette (CTRL-SHIFT-P)
- search for: "Python: Create Environment..."
- select: Venv
- choose Python interpreter (recommended: Python 3.9+)


3. Install the package in development mode:
```shell
pip install -e .[dev]
```

This installs the package with all development dependencies including:
- Testing tools (pytest, pytest-cov)
- Code formatting (black, ruff)
- Build tools (pyinstaller, wheel, twine)

### Git Configuration

The repository already includes a comprehensive [`.gitignore`](.gitignore) that covers:
- Virtual environments (`.venv/`, `venv/`)
- Build artifacts (`build/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`)
- Python cache files (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`)
- Test artifacts (`.pytest_cache/`, `.coverage`, `htmlcov/`)
- IDE files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)
- Log files (`*.log` - includes `vba_edit.log`, `vba_trust_access.log`)
- PyInstaller specs (`*.spec`)

No additional `.gitignore` configuration is needed.

## Development Workflow
### Running Tests
```shell
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run only unit tests
pytest -m "not integration"

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_cli.py -v
```

### Code Formatting and Linting
```shell
# Format code with black
black src tests

# Lint with ruff
ruff check src tests

# Fix linting issues automatically
ruff check --fix src tests
```
#### When to Run Code Formatting and Linting
1. Before Each Commit (Recommended)
This ensures your commits always contain properly formatted, clean code.

2. During Development (As Needed)
    - When you notice formatting inconsistencies
    - After making significant code changes
    - When working on a new feature or bug fix

3. Before Creating Pull Requests
Always run both tools to ensure code quality standards before submitting for review.

4. After Switching Branches
When switching between feature branches, especially if multiple developers are working on the project.

#### IDE Integration (Recommended)
For VS Code, you can configure automatic formatting on save by adding to your settings:
```json
{
    "python.formatting.provider": "black",
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "python.linting.ruffEnabled": true
}
```

This way, your code is automatically formatted and linted as you work, reducing the need for manual intervention.


### Testing CLI Commands
```shell
word-vba --help
excel-vba --help
access-vba --help

# Test check functionality
python -m vba_edit.utils
```

## Creating Binaries
```shell
# Create standalone executables
python create_binaries.py
```

Binaries will be in the dist/ directory

## Packaging
In Python packaging, a "build" command is commonly used to create distribution files for your project.
- `python -m build` is the standard way to build Python packages.
- It reads `pyproject.toml` and creates distributable files.

**Standard build command:**
```sh
python -m build
```
This uses the [`build`](https://pypi.org/project/build/) package to generate source (`.tar.gz`) and wheel (`.whl`) distributions in the dist directory.

**Steps:**
1. Install the build tool (if not already):
   ```sh
   pip install build
   ```
2. Run the build command:
   ```sh
   python -m build
   ```

## Deployment

You can use the official GitHub CLI tool [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) to upload an `.exe` (or any file) from a local directory to a GitHub release

### Example workflow

1. **Install GitHub CLI:**  
   [Download and install](https://cli.github.com/) for your platform.

2. **Authenticate:**  
   ```sh
   gh auth login
   ```

3. **Create a release (if needed):**  
   ```sh
   gh release create v1.0.0 --title "Release v1.0.0" --notes "Release notes here"
   ```

4. **Upload your `.exe` to the release:**  
   ```sh
   gh release upload v1.0.0 path/to/your/file.exe
   ```

You can upload any file from any location on your diskâ€”**it does not need to be tracked by git or in your repo folder**.

**Summary:**  
Use `gh release upload <tag> <file>` to add binaries to a GitHub release from anywhere on your system.
