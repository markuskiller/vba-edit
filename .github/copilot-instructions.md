# Project Overview

This project is a command line application that allows users to export, import and synchronize custom program code (VBA and PowerQuery) contained in Microsoft Office files.

## Folder Structure

- `/src`: Contains the source code
- `/docs`: Contains documentation for the project, including ideas for further enhancements and even programming guides for beginners.

## General Instructions

The project's language is English.

Write code (names of classes, objects, variables, methods, comments etc) always in the project language.

Also express all your answers in project language, even when prompted in any other language.
As an exception, the developer may ask for a translation of terms and sentences he or she doesn't understand, on his/her behalf.

## Version Control

Currently, some developers are new to working with Git, Github and Copilot.
When working on a feature, suggest which branch to use.

When the developer asks questions about tools he uses, switch to a different chat reserved for these questions.

Microsoft Copilot suggested the branching strategy outlined in .\docs\development\BRANCHING.md

## Github Copilot Modes

When in Agent mode, don't modify any code, unless you did check out to a new Git branch before.
Each prompt shall use the context @workspace automatically.
