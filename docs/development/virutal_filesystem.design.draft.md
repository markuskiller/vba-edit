onderhold: if you look at the Rubberduck codebase in Github (https://github.com/rubberduck-vba), can you detect how many lines in a VBA code module it looks up to find annotations?

GitHub Copilot: Rubberduck’s annotation parser (see [ParseTreeAnnotation.cs](https://github.com/rubberduck-vba/Rubberduck/blob/main/Rubberduck.Parsing/Annotations/ParseTreeAnnotation.cs)) does not use a fixed line count when searching for annotations in a VBA code module. Instead, it scans the code module line by line, typically starting from the top, and looks for annotation comments (e.g., `'@AnnotationName`) until it encounters the first non-comment, non-whitespace line (usually the first executable statement or declaration).

So, Rubberduck does not have a hard-coded limit for how many lines it looks up; it processes all leading comments at the top of the module. If you want a specific line count, you would need to check the implementation details, but as of the current codebase, it parses all contiguous comment lines at the start of the module.

**Summary:**  
Rubberduck looks at all leading comment lines at the top of a VBA module for annotations, not a fixed number of lines.

onderhold: ok, but it stops at the first non-comment, non-whitespace line. we should do the same.

GitHub Copilot: You can implement a function to extract all leading annotation comments (e.g., `'@Annotation`) from a VBA module, stopping at the first non-comment, non-whitespace line. Here’s a Python example for your codebase:

````python
def extract_leading_annotations(vba_code: str) -> list:
    """
    Extract leading annotation comments from VBA code, stopping at the first non-comment, non-whitespace line.

    Args:
        vba_code (str): The full VBA module code as a string.

    Returns:
        list: List of annotation comment lines (e.g., lines starting with `'@`).
    """
    annotations = []
    for line in vba_code.splitlines():
        stripped = line.strip()
        if not stripped or stripped.startswith("'"):
            if stripped.startswith("'@"):
                annotations.append(stripped)
            continue
        # Stop at first non-comment, non-whitespace line
        break
    return annotations

# Usage:
# annotations = extract_leading_annotations(module_code)
````

This matches Rubberduck’s behavior: it collects all annotation comments at the top, stopping at the first code or declaration line.

onderhold: please suggest on how to implement this in extract_rubberduck_folder and other places where applicable

GitHub Copilot: To match Rubberduck’s annotation parsing behavior (scan all leading comments, stop at first non-comment/non-whitespace line), you should update `extract_rubberduck_folder` and any annotation extraction logic to:

- **Scan only the leading comment lines** at the top of the code.
- **Stop at the first non-comment, non-whitespace line** (i.e., first code or declaration).

Here’s how you can update `extract_rubberduck_folder`:

````python
def extract_rubberduck_folder(self, code: str) -> Tuple[str, str]:
    """Extract Rubberduck @Folder annotation from leading comments in VBA code.

    Only scans leading comment lines, stopping at the first non-comment/non-whitespace line.

    Args:
        code: VBA code content

    Returns:
        Tuple of (folder_path, code_without_annotation)
    """
    if not self.use_rubberduck_folders:
        return "", code

    lines = code.splitlines()
    folder_path = ""
    leading_comment_lines = []
    rest_lines = []
    found_code = False

    for line in lines:
        stripped = line.strip()
        if not stripped or stripped.startswith("'"):
            leading_comment_lines.append(line)
            # Check for @Folder annotation in leading comments
            match = RUBBERDUCK_FOLDER_PATTERN.match(stripped)
            if match and not folder_path:
                folder_path = match.group(1).replace(".", os.sep)
        else:
            found_code = True
        if found_code:
            rest_lines.append(line)

    # Remove @Folder annotation from leading comments
    filtered_leading = [
        l for l in leading_comment_lines
        if not RUBBERDUCK_FOLDER_PATTERN.match(l.strip())
    ]

    # Reconstruct code without the annotation
    code_without_annotation = "\n".join(filtered_leading + rest_lines)

    return folder_path, code_without_annotation
````

**Where else to apply this logic?**
- If you have other annotation extraction (e.g., for other Rubberduck tags), use the same pattern:  
  **Scan only leading comments, stop at first code/declaration.**

**Summary:**  
- Always scan only the leading comments for annotations.
- Stop at the first non-comment/non-whitespace line.
- Remove the annotation from the code if needed.

Let me know if you want a utility function for general annotation extraction!

onderhold: @workspace i renamed extract_rubberduck_folder to get_rubberduck_folder. Are there any test scripts that I need to change because of this?

Workspace: Sammeln von ArbeitsbereichsinformationenYes, you need to update your test scripts to use `VBAComponentHandler.get_rubberduck_folder` instead of the old `extract_rubberduck_folder` name.

In particular, in test_cli.py, look for any usage of `extract_rubberduck_folder` and change it to `get_rubberduck_folder`. For example, in integration tests that verify folder annotation extraction during export/import, update the method call accordingly.

You should also check any other test files in tests that might reference the old method name. If you use `extract_rubberduck_folder` in your test utilities or fixtures, update those as well.

For reference, the correct usage is now:
```python
from vba_edit.office_vba import VBAComponentHandler

handler = VBAComponentHandler(use_rubberduck_folders=True)
folder_path, code = handler.get_rubberduck_folder(code)
```

See office_vba.py for the updated method definition.

onderhold: @workspace to that check for me

Workspace: Sammeln von ArbeitsbereichsinformationenThere are no references to `extract_rubberduck_folder` in your current workspace test scripts. All logic and tests should now use `VBAComponentHandler.get_rubberduck_folder`. 

If you previously had tests using `extract_rubberduck_folder`, you should update them to use `get_rubberduck_folder`. You can verify this by searching for `extract_rubberduck_folder` in your tests directory—there should be no matches.

If you want to be certain, run:

```sh
grep -r extract_rubberduck_folder tests/
```

If the result is empty, no changes are needed in your test scripts. If you find any, update them to use `get_rubberduck_folder` from office_vba.py.

onderhold: which changes are needed for get_rubberduck_folder to match Rubberduck’s annotation parsing behavior (scan all leading comments, stop at first non-comment/non-whitespace line)?

GitHub Copilot: To match Rubberduck’s annotation parsing behavior, `get_rubberduck_folder` should:

- **Scan only the leading comment lines** at the top of the code.
- **Stop at the first non-comment, non-whitespace line** (i.e., first code or declaration).
- **Remove the annotation line from the returned code**.

Here’s how you should update `get_rubberduck_folder`:

````

**Summary of changes:**
- Only scans leading comments.
- Stops at first non-comment/non-whitespace line.
- Removes the annotation line from the returned code.

This matches Rubberduck’s annotation parsing behavior.

onderhold: why are you alway suggesting to return the code without annotation? that's wrong and makes me doubt your whole suggestion

GitHub Copilot: Thank you for your feedback—your concern is valid.

Rubberduck’s annotation parsing **does not remove the annotation from the code**; it only reads the annotation from the leading comments and leaves the code unchanged. My previous suggestions to remove the annotation line were incorrect for strict Rubberduck compatibility.

**Correct behavior:**  
- Scan leading comments for the annotation.
- Stop at the first non-comment/non-whitespace line.
- **Do not modify or remove annotation lines from the code.**  
- Return the folder path and the original code (unchanged).

Your current implementation in `get_rubberduck_folder` is correct in this respect:

```python
# ...existing code...
for line in lines:
    stripped = line.strip()
    match = RUBBERDUCK_FOLDER_PATTERN.match(stripped)
    if match:
        folder_path = match.group(1).replace(".", os.sep)
        break
# Return the folder path and the original code
return folder_path, code
# ...existing code...
```

**Summary:**  
You should keep returning the code unchanged, just as Rubberduck does. Thank you for catching this!

onderhold: please, i want this correct behaviour of reading the annotation and returning the code without modifications mixed with matching Rubberduck’s annotation parsing behavior of scaning all leading comments but stopping at first non-comment/non-whitespace line

GitHub Copilot: Here’s how to update `get_rubberduck_folder` to **match Rubberduck’s annotation parsing behavior**:

- **Scan only leading comments** at the top of the code.
- **Stop at the first non-comment/non-whitespace line**.
- **Read the annotation if present**.
- **Return the folder path and the original code (unmodified)**.

Replace your current `get_rubberduck_folder` with the following:

````python
def get_rubberduck_folder(self, code: str) -> Tuple[str, str]:
    """Find Rubberduck @Folder in leading comments of VBA code.

    Only scans leading comment lines, stopping at the first non-comment/non-whitespace line,

            continue
        # Stop at first non-comment/non-whitespace line
        break

    return folder_path, code
````

**This implementation:**
- Only looks for annotations in the leading comments.
- Stops scanning as soon as it hits code or a declaration.
- Returns the annotation (if found) and the code unchanged.

This matches Rubberduck’s annotation parsing behavior exactly.

onderhold: it should also stop scanning after finding the first folder annotation

GitHub Copilot: Here’s an improved version of `get_rubberduck_folder` that:

- Scans only leading comments.
- Stops at the first non-comment/non-whitespace line.
- Stops scanning after finding the **first folder annotation**.
- Returns the folder path and the original code (unmodified).

Replace your method with:

onderhold: zeige leerraum

GitHub Copilot: Es gibt in der README.md keine übermäßigen Leerraum-Abschnitte. Die Formatierung ist kompakt und nutzt Leerzeilen sinnvoll zur Gliederung (z.B. zwischen Überschriften, Absätzen, Codeblöcken und Listen).  
Falls du bestimmte Bereiche meinst, die zu viel Leerraum haben, nenne bitte die Zeilennummer oder den Abschnitt.

onderhold: wie kann ich in VS Code Leerzeichen, Tabs und Zeilenumbrüche anzeigen lassen?

GitHub Copilot: In Visual Studio Code kannst du Leerzeichen, Tabs und Zeilenumbrüche wie folgt anzeigen lassen:

1. **Alle Steuerzeichen anzeigen:**  
   Klicke unten rechts in der Statusleiste auf das Symbol mit dem umgedrehten ¶ (Pilcrow) oder  
   drücke `Strg + Umschalt + P` und gib ein:  
   ```
   Ansicht: Rendern von Leerzeichen umschalten
   ```
   (Befehl: `Toggle Render Whitespace`)

2. **Immer anzeigen:**  
   Öffne die Einstellungen (`Strg + ,`) und suche nach  
   ```
   render whitespace
   ```
   Setze die Option **Render Whitespace** auf `all`.

Dadurch werden Leerzeichen als kleine Punkte, Tabs als Pfeile und Zeilenumbrüche als ¶ angezeigt.

onderhold: is the description of the common options correct in respect to the code?

GitHub Copilot: Die Beschreibung der **Common Options** im README.md stimmt größtenteils mit dem Code überein.  
Hier ein Abgleich mit den wichtigsten Optionen aus deinem Code (z. B. `src\vba_edit\cli.py`):

- `--file, -f`: Pfad zur Office-Datei – korrekt.
- `--vba-directory`: Verzeichnis für VBA-Dateien – korrekt.
- `--encoding, -e`: Zeichencodierung angeben – korrekt.
- `--detect-encoding, -d`: Automatische Erkennung der Codierung – korrekt.
- `--save-headers`: Modul-Header separat speichern – korrekt.
- `--verbose, -v`: Detailliertes Logging aktivieren – korrekt.
- `--logfile, -l`: Logging in Datei aktivieren – korrekt.
- `--rubberduck-folders, -rdf`: RubberduckVBA-Ordnerannotation verwenden – korrekt.

**Fazit:**  
Die Beschreibung der Optionen im README.md entspricht den Parametern, die im Code verwendet werden.  
Falls du eine bestimmte Option im Code vermisst oder eine Option im README nicht findest, nenne bitte die Option für einen gezielten Abgleich.

onderhold: is there no short form of the option --save-headers implemented?

GitHub Copilot: Correct, there is **no short form** (like `-s`) for the option `--save-headers` implemented in the code.  
The README lists only `--save-headers`, and a review of the CLI code confirms that this option does **not** have a short alias. Only the long form `--save-headers` is available.

onderhold: what do you think about providing a --conf option that references the options to be used?

GitHub Copilot: Providing a `--conf` option is a good idea for usability and reproducibility.  
With `--conf <configfile>`, users could specify a configuration file (e.g., YAML, INI, or JSON) containing all desired options and values. This:

- Simplifies command-line usage for complex workflows.
- Makes it easy to share and reuse settings.
- Reduces errors from long command lines.

**Implementation notes:**
- Parse the config file at startup.
- Command-line options should override config file values if both are provided.
- Document the config file format and precedence in the README.

**Example usage:**
```shell
word-vba export --conf settings.yaml
```

This approach is common in CLI tools and would make `vba-edit` more flexible for advanced users.

onderhold: __init__.py and pyproject.toml both contain a version definition. can this somehow be unified?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can unify the version definition by having a **single source of truth** for your project version.  
The recommended approach is:

- **Define the version only in pyproject.toml.**
- In __init__.py, read the version dynamically from pyproject.toml (or use a tool to inject it).

### Option 1: Use `importlib.metadata` (Python ≥3.8)

```python
from importlib.metadata import version, PackageNotFoundError

try:
    __version__ = version("vba-editRD")
except PackageNotFoundError:
    __version__ = "unknown"
```

This reads the version from the installed package metadata, which is set from pyproject.toml.

### Option 2: Use a tool like `bumpver` or `setuptools_scm`

You already use `bumpver` and have file patterns configured in pyproject.toml:
```toml
[tool.bumpver.file_patterns]
    "pyproject.toml" = [
        'current_version = "{version}"',
        'version = "{version}"',
    ]
    "src/vba_edit/__init__.py" = ["{version}"]
```
This means when you bump the version, `bumpver` will update both files automatically.

**Summary:**  
- If you want true single-source, use `importlib.metadata` in `__init__.py`.
- If you want explicit version strings in both files, keep using `bumpver` as configured.

**Best practice:**  
Prefer dynamic reading (`importlib.metadata`) for less manual maintenance and avoid version mismatches.

onderhold: how does bumpver work? do I have to trigger/execute it myself?

GitHub Copilot: `bumpver` is a CLI tool for managing and updating version numbers in your project files.  
You **trigger it manually** via the command line when you want to bump the version.

### How it works in your setup

- You define the current version and file patterns in pyproject.toml.
- When you run a `bumpver` command, it updates the version in all configured files (e.g., pyproject.toml, __init__.py, etc.).
- It can also commit the change to git, tag it, and push (depending on your config).

### Typical usage

To bump the patch version:
```sh
bumpver update --patch
```
To bump the minor version:
```sh
bumpver update --minor
```
To bump the major version:
```sh
bumpver update --major
```
Or interactively:
```sh
bumpver update
```

### Summary

- **You must execute `bumpver` yourself**—it does not run automatically.
- It updates all files listed in `[tool.bumpver.file_patterns]` in your pyproject.toml.
- It helps keep your version numbers in sync across files.

onderhold: how about the importlib.metadata, can I use this for package_name in \__init\__.py as well?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can use `importlib.metadata` to dynamically get both the version and the package name in __init__.py.  
However, the package name is typically static (e.g., `"vba-editRD"`), while the version is dynamic.

Here’s how you can do it:

````python
from importlib.metadata import version, PackageNotFoundError

package_name = "vba-editRD"

try:
    __version__ = version(package_name)
except PackageNotFoundError:
    __version__ = "unknown"

__author__ = "onderhold"
__description__ = "Enable seamless MS Office VBA code editing in preferred editor or IDE"
````

**Notes:**
- `package_name` should match the name in your pyproject.toml.
- This approach ensures `__version__` is always in sync with your installed package metadata.
- You still need to set `package_name` manually, as `importlib.metadata` does not provide a way to discover the package name from within the code.

**Summary:**  
- Use `importlib.metadata.version(package_name)` for the version.
- Keep `package_name` as a static string.

onderhold: but if I would set package_name in \__init\__.py the same as "name" in pyproject.toml, could this be done dynamically?

GitHub Copilot: No, you **cannot set `package_name` dynamically from pyproject.toml at runtime** using standard Python tools.  
Python code does not have direct access to the pyproject.toml metadata at runtime.

**What you can do:**
- Set `package_name` manually in __init__.py to match the name in pyproject.toml.
- Dynamically get the version using `importlib.metadata.version(package_name)`.

**Example:**
````python
from importlib.metadata import version, PackageNotFoundError

package_name = "vba-editRD"

try:
    __version__ = version(package_name)
except PackageNotFoundError:
    __version__ = "unknown"

__author__ = "onderhold"
__description__ = "Enable seamless MS Office VBA code editing in preferred editor or IDE"
````

**Summary:**  
- `package_name` must be set manually.
- The version can be read dynamically.
- There is no built-in way for Python to read the package name from pyproject.toml at runtime.

onderhold: so then, could I use bumpver to set package_name?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you **can use bumpver to set `package_name`** in your __init__.py, but this is not typical or recommended.  
`bumpver` is designed to update version strings, not package names, since the package name rarely changes.

**How it would work:**
- You would add a file pattern for `package_name` in your `[tool.bumpver.file_patterns]` section in pyproject.toml.
- When you run `bumpver`, it would update both the version and the package name wherever you specify.

**Example file pattern:**
```toml
[tool.bumpver.file_patterns]
"src/vba_edit/__init__.py" = [
    '__version__ = "{version}"',
    'package_name = "{package_name}"'
]
```
But:  
- `bumpver` only updates the version by default.  
- You would need to manually trigger a package name change, which is rare and not automated.

**Summary:**  
- Technically possible, but not standard practice.
- The package name should be set manually and only changed if you rename your project.
- Use `bumpver` for version updates; keep `package_name` static unless you have a special use case.

onderhold: when I change package_name in \__init\__.py, where else will I have to change it?

GitHub Copilot: If you change `package_name` in __init__.py, you should also update it in the following places:

1. **pyproject.toml**  
   - The `[project]` section’s `name` field must match your new package name:
     ```toml
     name = "your-new-package-name"
     ```

2. **Anywhere you reference the package name in your code**  
   - For example, in other modules (like `excel_vba.py`) if you import or use `package_name` from __init__.py.

3. **Documentation and README files**  
   - Update installation instructions, usage examples, and references to the package name.

4. **Setup scripts or CI/CD configs**  
   - If you use scripts or workflows that reference the package name (e.g., for publishing to PyPI), update those as well.

5. **Import statements (if you rename the actual package directory)**  
   - If you rename the folder `vba_edit` itself, update all import statements accordingly.

**Summary:**  
Change the package name in __init__.py, pyproject.toml, and anywhere else it is referenced in code, docs, or scripts.  
The most critical is pyproject.toml—it must match for packaging and distribution.

onderhold: what are the requirements for package_version? can I use e.g. "0.3.1-rdf"?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can use a version string like `"0.3.1-rdf"` for `package_version`.  
The requirements for `package_version` are:

- It should be a valid [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/) version string for Python packages.
- `"0.3.1-rdf"` is valid as a [local version identifier](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#local-version-identifiers).
- This string is typically set in your pyproject.toml under `version = "0.3.1-rdf"`.
- `package_version` in your code is just a variable holding the version string, so it can be any string, but for packaging and distribution, it should follow PEP 440.

**Summary:**  
You can use `"0.3.1-rdf"` for `package_version` as long as it matches the version in your pyproject.toml and follows PEP 440 conventions.

onderhold: do I have to define  \__author\__ and \__description\__ ?

GitHub Copilot: No, you do **not** have to define `__author__` and `__description__` in your __init__.py.  
They are **optional** and are mainly for informational purposes.

- `__author__` is sometimes used by tools or for documentation, but it is not required by Python packaging.
- `__description__` is not a standard Python variable; it is just a custom string for your own use.

**Required for packaging:**  
- The `name`, `version`, `description`, and `authors` fields in your pyproject.toml are what matter for packaging and distribution.

**Summary:**  
You can remove `__author__` and `__description__` from __init__.py if you do not need them. They are not required.

onderhold: is it common to use three letter abreviations as short option names?

GitHub Copilot: No, it is **not common** to use three-letter abbreviations as short option names in command-line tools.  
The standard convention is to use **single-letter** short options (e.g., `-f`, `-v`, `-e`).  
Three-letter abbreviations (like `-rdf`) are unusual and may confuse users, as most CLI tools expect short options to be a single character.  
If you need a mnemonic or longer abbreviation, it’s better to use the full option name (e.g., `--rubberduck-folders`).

onderhold: ok, I removed the -rdf short form from cli_common.py. Somewhere else that I need to remove it?

GitHub Copilot: You only need to remove the `-rdf` short form wherever the CLI arguments are defined or documented.

**Checklist:**
1. **Code:**  
   - You have already removed it from cli_common.py.  
   - Check other CLI-related files (e.g., `word_vba.py`, `excel_vba.py`, `access_vba.py`) for any direct usage of `-rdf`.

2. **Documentation:**  
   - Update the README and any help texts or usage examples that mention `-rdf`.
   - Check for references in docstrings, comments, or example scripts.

3. **Tests:**  
   - Search your tests directory for any test cases using `-rdf` and update them.

**Summary:**  
If you only defined `-rdf` in cli_common.py, and nowhere else, you are done.  
Otherwise, update all code, docs, and tests to remove references to `-rdf`.  
A quick search for `-rdf` in your project will confirm if anything remains.

onderhold: is there something like a "build" command in Python?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, in Python packaging, a "build" command is commonly used to create distribution files for your project.

**Standard build command:**
```sh
python -m build
```
This uses the [`build`](https://pypi.org/project/build/) package to generate source (`.tar.gz`) and wheel (`.whl`) distributions in the dist directory.

**Steps:**
1. Install the build tool (if not already):
   ```sh
   pip install build
   ```
2. Run the build command:
   ```sh
   python -m build
   ```

**Summary:**  
- `python -m build` is the standard way to build Python packages.
- It reads your pyproject.toml and creates distributable files.

onderhold: how and where do offer binaries in my github repo, and will building those also included in ````python -m build````?

GitHub Copilot: ### Offering binaries in your GitHub repo

1. **Release Assets:**  
   The most common way is to upload your built binaries (e.g., `.whl`, `.tar.gz`, `.exe`) as assets to a [GitHub Release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/creating-releases).
   - Go to your repo’s "Releases" page.
   - Create a new release (or edit an existing one).
   - Attach your binary files.

2. **CI/CD Automation:**  
   You can automate building and uploading binaries using GitHub Actions.  
   Example: After building with `python -m build`, use an action to upload the files to the release.

---

### Does `python -m build` include binaries?

- `python -m build` creates **Python package distributions**:  
  - Source distribution (`.tar.gz`)
  - Wheel distribution (`.whl`)
- These are placed in the dist folder.
- **It does NOT create standalone executables** (like `.exe`).  
  For that, use tools like `pyinstaller` or `cx_Freeze`.

**Summary:**  
- Use `python -m build` to create `.whl` and `.tar.gz` for PyPI and releases.
- Upload these files as release assets on GitHub.
- For true binaries (`.exe`), use a packaging tool and upload those separately.

onderhold: can I also store the binary executables somewhere in my local repo, and then push it to Github in a way that they will be included in a release?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can store binary executables (e.g., `.exe`, `.whl`, `.tar.gz`) in your local repo, but **it is not recommended to commit them directly to your repository** because:

- They will bloat your repository size.
- They are not source code and are better managed as release assets.

**Recommended workflow:**

1. **Build your binaries locally** (e.g., with `python -m build` or `pyinstaller`).
2. **Do NOT commit them to your repo.**
3. Instead, when you want to publish a release:
   - Go to your repo’s "Releases" page on GitHub.
   - Create a new release (or edit an existing one).
   - Upload your binaries as release assets.

**Automated alternative:**  
Use GitHub Actions to build your binaries and automatically attach them to a release.

**Summary:**  
- Build binaries locally.
- Upload them as release assets on GitHub.
- Do not commit binaries to your source repository.  
This keeps your repo clean and follows best practices.

onderhold: is there some sort of tool that I can use to add an .exe to a Github release from a local directory which is not in the local repo?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can use the official GitHub CLI tool [`gh`](https://cli.github.com/) to upload an `.exe` (or any file) from a local directory to a GitHub release, **even if the file is not in your local repo**.

### Example workflow

1. **Install GitHub CLI:**  
   [Download and install](https://cli.github.com/) for your platform.

2. **Authenticate:**  
   ```sh
   gh auth login
   ```

3. **Create a release (if needed):**  
   ```sh
   gh release create v1.0.0 --title "Release v1.0.0" --notes "Release notes here"
   ```

4. **Upload your `.exe` to the release:**  
   ```sh
   gh release upload v1.0.0 path/to/your/file.exe
   ```

You can upload any file from any location on your disk—**it does not need to be tracked by git or in your repo folder**.

**Summary:**  
Use `gh release upload <tag> <file>` to add binaries to a GitHub release from anywhere on your system.

onderhold: What do these tools perform, and how do I integrate them in my development process. Some automatic triggering?
black src tests
ruff check src tests
ruff check --fix src tests

GitHub Copilot: Here’s what these tools do and how you can integrate them into your development process:

---

### What do these tools perform?

- **`black src tests`**  
  Formats your Python code in the src and tests directories according to the [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) code style.  
  *Purpose:* Ensures consistent code formatting automatically.

- **`ruff check src tests`**  
  Runs [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) to lint your code for errors, style issues, and potential bugs in the src and tests directories.  
  *Purpose:* Finds code quality and style issues.

- **`ruff check --fix src tests`**  
  Runs Ruff and automatically fixes any issues it can (e.g., formatting, unused imports).  
  *Purpose:* Cleans up code by fixing linting issues automatically.

---

### How to integrate them in your development process

1. **Manual use:**  
   Run these commands before committing code to ensure formatting and linting are correct.

2. **Pre-commit hooks (automatic triggering):**  
   You can automate these checks using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/):
   - Install pre-commit:  
     ```sh
     pip install pre-commit
     ```
   - Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in your repo:
     ```yaml
     repos:
       - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
         rev: stable
         hooks:
           - id: black
             args: [src, tests]
       - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
         rev: v0.4.0
         hooks:
           - id: ruff
             args: [src, tests]
           - id: ruff-fix
             args: [src, tests]
     ```
   - Install the hooks:
     ```sh
     pre-commit install
     ```
   Now, every time you commit, `black` and `ruff` will run automatically on your code.

3. **CI Integration:**  
   Add these commands to your CI workflow (e.g., GitHub Actions) to enforce code quality on every push or pull request.

---

**Summary:**  
- `black` formats code, `ruff` checks and fixes linting issues.
- Use them manually, with pre-commit hooks, or in CI for automation.
- Pre-commit hooks are the most common way to trigger them automatically before each commit.

onderhold: where will create_binaries.py store the executables?

GitHub Copilot: By default, create_binaries.py uses PyInstaller’s standard behavior, which stores the generated executables in the dist directory located in the same folder where the script is run.

So, after running create_binaries.py, you will find:
- `word-vba.exe` in word-vba.exe
- `excel-vba.exe` in excel-vba.exe

unless you specify a different output directory with the `--distpath` option in your PyInstaller arguments.

onderhold: @workspace The most elegant solution to keep the file system and the VBA editor in sync would be to implement a virtual filesystem that mirrors the structure of the VBA project. At least in form of a VS Code extension this could be made without too much effort, wouldn't it?

Workspace: Sammeln von ArbeitsbereichsinformationenYes, implementing a virtual filesystem as a VS Code extension is feasible and would simplify syncing between the file system and the VBA editor. VS Code’s [FileSystemProvider API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/virtual-filesystem) allows you to expose a virtual file tree that mirrors the VBA project structure. This approach would let users browse, edit, and save VBA modules directly in VS Code, with changes reflected in the Office document.

You could leverage the existing logic in office_vba.py for module import/export and folder mapping, and use a provider to present modules and folders as files. For advanced scenarios, libraries like `pyfilesystem2` or `fusepy` could be used for broader OS integration, but for VS Code, the extension API is sufficient and well-documented.

onderhold: Could you help me drafting and developing such an extension?

GitHub Copilot: Absolutely! Here’s a draft plan and initial development steps for a VS Code extension that provides a virtual filesystem mirroring a VBA project:

---

## Draft Plan: VS Code VBA Virtual Filesystem Extension

### 1. **Goals**
- Present the VBA project structure (folders, modules, forms) as a virtual file tree in VS Code.
- Allow editing VBA modules directly in VS Code.
- Sync changes between the Office document and the file system automatically.

### 2. **Core Components**
- **FileSystemProvider:** Implements VS Code’s virtual filesystem API.
- **VBA Project Bridge:** Python backend (using your existing `vba-edit` logic) to read/write VBA modules.
- **Extension Host:** TypeScript/JavaScript code that communicates with the Python backend.

### 3. **Development Steps**

#### A. VS Code Extension Skeleton
- Use `yo code` to scaffold a new extension:
  ```sh
  npm install -g yo generator-code
  yo code
  ```
- Choose “New Extension (TypeScript)” and set up your project.

#### B. Implement FileSystemProvider
- In your extension, create a class that implements [`FileSystemProvider`](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/virtual-filesystem).
- This class will handle file/folder listing, reading, writing, and change events.

#### C. Python Backend
- Expose your `vba-edit` logic via a simple REST API, WebSocket, or CLI interface.
- The backend should support:
  - Listing modules/folders
  - Reading module code
  - Writing module code
  - Syncing changes to the Office document

#### D. Communication Layer
- Use Node.js `child_process` to call Python scripts, or use HTTP/WebSocket for more advanced scenarios.
- The extension host will call the backend to fetch/update VBA project data.

#### E. UI Integration
- Register the virtual filesystem as a new workspace or explorer view.
- Optionally, add commands for “Sync”, “Export”, “Import”, etc.

#### F. Testing & Packaging
- Test with sample Office documents.
- Package and publish the extension to the VS Code Marketplace.

---

## Example: FileSystemProvider Skeleton (TypeScript)

````typescript
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

export class VbaFsProvider implements vscode.FileSystemProvider {
    // Implement required methods: stat, readDirectory, readFile, writeFile, etc.
    // Use Python backend to fetch/update VBA modules

    onDidChangeFile: vscode.Event<vscode.FileChangeEvent[]>;

    // ...implementation...
}
````

---

## Next Steps

1. Scaffold the extension (`yo code`).
2. Implement the `FileSystemProvider` skeleton.
3. Connect to your Python backend for VBA project operations.
4. Iterate and test with real Office documents.
